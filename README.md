# X_MAP361
Project of order estimators from MAP361 course of Ã‰cole Polytechnique (1st year course).

This project contains the following studies:

- Determe the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of the kth order statistic of a sample.
- Construct estimators for the upper bound of a uniform random variable from order statistics and test their bias and quadratic risk.
- Identify the optimal estimator with respect to the quadratic risk.
